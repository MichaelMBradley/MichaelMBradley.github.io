## [CS:GO Case Values](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/CSGOCaseValues)

![The expected values of many cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelMBradley/CSGOCaseValues/master/img/expectedvalue.png)

In this project I scrape some data from [the internet](https://csgostash.com/) and analyze it to see if it's possible to make money by opening cases in [CS:GO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/).

(Spoiler alert: It isn't)

## [Detailing](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/Detailing)

The code I'm writing for my internship at Carleton University. I'm looking into topics like circle packing and tree traversal. It's not solving cancer, but it's interesting enough. Read more on my [blog](https://michaelmbradley.github.io/Detailing/).

## [mp4topptx](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/mp4topptx)

A quick script I wrote up as a joke to turn an mp4 into a powerpoint file. Just hold the button for the next slide and let the video play for you (no audio yet). I'll probably find a way to implement some functionality from youtube-dl later to get a powerpoint straight from a Youtube video.

## [SteamVR Skin Swapper](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/SteamVR-Skin-Swapper)

*I haven't tested this in a while so I'm not sure if it still works.
Even when it did "work" it was buggy and I had only tested it on my own machine*

[SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/steamvr) used to have a fun feature where you could swap out the look of your controllers and base stations. It's still possible, but you have to do it manually. I wrote this code to automate it (and learn some Java, as this was one of the first prjects I did).

## [Project Euler](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/Project-Euler)

I do some of [the problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) from time to time, and I put my code here if anyone else wants to see my not-very-good solutions.

## [This website](https://github.com/MichaelMBradley/MichaelMBradley.github.io)

I made [this website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) partially because I wanted one, and partially to learn about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
